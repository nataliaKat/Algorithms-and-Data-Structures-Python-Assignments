# Count Fixed Polyominoes
This algorithm computes the number of different polyominoes which can be made with n squares. A polyomino is a polygon made with n squares such that at least one edge of each square is attached to another. 

## Usage
```bash
python count_fixed_polyominoes.py [-p] <n>
```
where <<n>n> is the polyomino size and [-p] is an option argument for printing the constructed graph.<br>
